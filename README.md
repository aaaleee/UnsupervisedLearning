# UnsupervisedLearning

This is my jupyter notebook for the Unsupervised learning final project.

For this project I'll be using a dataset about credit card purchases that seems to have a significant number of features and rows. The dataset contains different data columns for unique customers and is meant to be used to explore customer card purchase behaviors, there's balances, frequency, minimum payments, and a lot of other interesting features. It doesn't seem to be synthetic, and there needs to be a bit of cleanup done before we can use it.

The primary objective is to apply and compare multiple unsupervised learning models:

K-Means clustering on both the full feature set and on PCA-reduced data
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and visualization
Hierarchical Clustering on the PCA-transformed dataset
We will build three models:

K-means with the full, non PCA processed data
K-means with PCA reduced data
Hierarchical Clustering with PCA reduced data
